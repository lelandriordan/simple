Simple
======

As WordPress has grown from small blogging platform to full blown CMS, WordPress themes have evolved into massive overly complex monstrosities. Inspired by Svtble and Medium, Simple is a minimal theme designed to get rid of theme bloat and back to the basics of blogging.

## Basic Usage
Download the zip and upload it to the WordPress backend. Eventually Simple will be submitted to the WordPress theme repository.

## Developer Usage

1. Make sure that you have Node, NPM, Gulp and Sass installed globally on local dev machine.
2. Download or clone the repo into the default themes directory.
3. Run `npm install` to install Gulp and its dependencies.
4. Activate Simple in the WordPress admin.
5. Run `gulp` to automatically watch and compile Sass changes.
